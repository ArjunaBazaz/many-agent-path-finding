- algorithm for effecient many-agent path finding:
  - do A* starting from both the front and the end
  - have two queues, one for each starting point
  - once a new value is added to a queue, check if it's pairing with every value in the other queue already has a route saved
  - once the route is found, store every permutation of it
    - perhaps this can be a linked list kind of situation to reduce power
      - like best_move<(A, B)> = C, do C, then you can do best_ move<(C, B)> to get the next move
